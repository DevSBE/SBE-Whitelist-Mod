The Whitelist mod is still in BETA and I'm still testing it. This mod will help you to add/remove and orginize.

Here is a list of all commands!

/wl GUI - Opens the mod GUI

/wl list - Shows you a list of all your whitelists

/wl remove all - Removes all of your whitelists
/wl add (Username) - Adds a specific player to your whitelist

/wl remove (Username) - Removes a specific player from your whitelist

/wl orginaze - Organizes your whitelist by letter
