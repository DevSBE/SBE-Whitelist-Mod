# SBE-Whitelist-Mod
The Whitelist mod is still in BETA and I'm still testing it. This mod will help you to add/remove and orginize.

Here is a list of all commands!

/wl GUI - Opens the mod GUI
/wl list - Shows you a list of all your whitelists
/wl remove all - Removes all of your whitelists
/wl add (Username) - Adds a specific player to your whitelist
